128Bit AES
Author: Alexander Lannon

This program implements an 128 bit version of the AES encryption algorithim. The program takes in two text files, the first is the message to be encrypted and the second is the key to be used. The text files must contain 16 hexadecimal values each, seperated by spaces. There are 2 included test files as a reference if needed. The program then applies encryption and decryption and outputs its steps along the way.

To compile the program in unix simply type "javac AES.java"
To run the program type "java AES 'plainText.txt' 'key.txt'" where plainText.txt and key.txt are text files with the input plain text and key respectively
